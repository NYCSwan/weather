# Rain Rain Go Away

Check the weather without having the inconvenience of actually sticking your head outside. Going on vacation? Make sure you packed the right clothes for the weather.

## Getting started

clone and install dependencies
`npm install`

start in dev mode on localhost:3000:
`npm run start`

## Notes

a. query a city by 1) name; and 2) longitude and latitude
b. first time the user comes to the site, query to be by their current location
c. present the user the temperature, humidity, and pressure in the location they chose in a graph

### TBD

- refactor state to use context

##

- Routes
- api call
- location
